Before the easter break we had the pleasure to welcome [Nasrullah
Iqbal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nasrullahiqbal/) as our very first expert
speaker at AITU. Nasrullah is a veteran in the field of artificial intelligence:
After completing his studies in software engineering and artificial intelligence
in 2006, he started working in industry at the [International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea](https://www.ices.dk/) as an Enterprise Architect.

<br />

At AITU, Nasrullah talked about the **history of artificial intelligence** from
the early 20th century to the present day. It was exicting to hear how humans
have always tried to teach machines how to autonomously solve problems and it
was insightful to see the many (failed) attempts over the years, like coding a
huge **knowledge-based system** through a logical programming language like
LISP.

For many of AITU's members the idea that artificial intelligence is not a new
field of research was really surprising. Nasrullah pointed out that that many of
today's advances are based on theories and ideas that have been around for
decades, but only now flourish because of advances in computing power and
the wide-spread availability of data through the rise of the Internet in the
2000s.

<br />

After his talk we had the great opportunity to ask him questions about his
career, the future of AI and the current state of the field. Thanks Nasrullah
for this insightful talk and sharing your knowledge with us. 🙌

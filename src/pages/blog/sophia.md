AITU has been invited to watch [Sophia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19757646/), which was shown as part of the Science category in the festival on March 25th. In this blog post, we want to reflect on some of our thoughts on the movie and the robot Sophia from the perspective of artificial intelligence. Enjoy! üôå

You might have already heard about Sophia - it is arguably the most well-known humanoid in existence. It [featured on The Tonight Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-zyTlZQYpE), [talked to Will Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml9v3wHLuWI), [was granted citizenship rights in Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Ox6H64yu8) and [spoke in front of the United Nations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNoTjrgMUcs) to just name a few of Sophia's viral hits.

Sophia is a product of [Hanson Robotics](https://www.hansonrobotics.com), a Hong Kong-based robotics company led by its CEO David Hanson, that was created with the motivation to humanise robotics by creating a robot that resembles humans' outer appearance and facial expressions most accurately.

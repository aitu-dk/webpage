# AITU Webpage

This repository holds the source code for the [AITU
Website](https://aitu.group).

## üåü Techstack

The project is built using the modern JS framework Astro and follows a minimal
project setup. It utilises native HTML, CSS, and JS (in .astro files) as much as
possible. The packages used are:

- [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [ThreeJS](https://www.threejs.org) for 3d rendering
- [Three Noise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-noise) for creating Perlin
  noise vector field
- [Fontsource DM-Sans](https://fontsource.org/fonts/dm-sans) for custom font

We also use
[@astrojs/tailwind](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)
to integrate Tailwind with Astro.

## üöÄ Project Structure

The project structure broadly follows the default `Astro` file structure:

```plain

‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

The `public` directory contains all publicly available assets such as images,
icons (including the favicon), and other metadata used by web crawlers for
indexing the webpage. All global site assets directly reside in `/public` and
should not be modified without good reason. Assets added over time should be
saved in one of the following directories depending on the asset type:

- The directory `public/authors` contains small images/ illustrations of all
  authors
- The directory `public/posts` contains sub-directories for the assets directly
  for each blog post
- The directory `public/assets` contains all other assets

All newly static images should be compressed to a size of _max. 150KB_ and be in
`jpg` format.

The `src` directory contains all source code, mostly .astro files which include
JSX-like HTML syntax, (Tailwind-)CSS, and Java/Typescript support. The layout
component holds two base layouts, that apply global styles. All styles are
wrapped in the `Layout.astro` component and all blog posts are additionally
wrapped in the `BlogLayout.astro` component. The pages component configures all
available routes. By default, there are just three routes `/`, `/join`, and
`/blog`. All individual blog articles are stored as Markdown files, see the
_Writing a Blog Post section_ for details.

## üßû Contributing

To contribute to this project in the form of adding blog posts, fixing bugs, or
improving functionality, please clone this repository and follow the
instructions below.

First, create a local copy of the repository. If you have [GitHub
CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) installed, you can use the
following command to clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
gh repo clone aitu-dk/webpage
cd webpage
```

If you don't have GitHub CLI, feel free to use the following command which uses
the standard `git` CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aitu-dk/webpage
cd webpage
```

Next, let's run the project locally. To run the project, you need to have
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Make sure that you have a recent
version of node installed. You can check your current version, which should
`>19`:

```bash
node --version
```

If your `node` version is too low, you can install a recent version through the
[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) `nvm`.

To install the dependencies of the project you need have to install the project
dependencies. You can choose any package manager of your liking, like `npm`,
`yarn` or `pnpm`. However, we recommend that you use `yarn` and assume that you
have it installed for the reet of this walk-through. To

```bash
yarn install
```

This should install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. Once
the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally using the
following command:

```bash
astro dev
```

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:3000` and you can visit the
website in your web browser. Now you can start to implement your changes.
Depending on the type of change, we would like you to develop your changes on a
new branch and open a pull request to the `main` branch:

- If you are writing a blog post, create a branch `blog/<blog-name>`
- If you are adding a feature, create a branch `feat/<feat-name>`
- If you are fixing an issue, create a branch `fix/<fix-name>`

You can create and change to a new branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Make changes to the code and commit them to the branch using `git add` and `git
commit -m` (Make an effort for descriptive commit messages). Once you are
finished, push the branch to the remote repository. You can do this using the
following command:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

Once the branch is pushed to the remote repository, you can open a pull request
using the GitHub CLI (`gh pr create`) or from the GitHub website.

## üóíÔ∏è Writing a Blog Post

Before starting to write a blog post, you should first create a new branch for
your blog post. See the _Contributing_ section for details. Once you have
created a new branch, you can start writing your blog post.

### Adding Blog Metadata

Create a new file `<new-blogpost>.md` in the directory `src/pages/blog`. The
first thing you wanna do is to add frontmatter to your blog post. As of now, the
webpage does not provide a lot of error handling, so not providing the expected
metadata about a post is likely to cause the site to crash. Below you will find
the metadata for our very first blog article, feel free to copy it and then
adjust it with the correct information.

_Note: The file `src/utils/types.ts` defines a type `Frontmatter`. See it to
know the precise types of all the fields._

```md

layout: ../../layouts/BlogLayout.astro
slug: intro-post
title: AITU's First Meeting! üéâ
description:
  We are official! AITU is officially registered as a student organisation at
  ITU. In this post we talk about everything from the organisation's idea and
  mission, and provide some behind-the-scenes into the foundational work in the
  two months before semester start.
authors:
  - Ludek Cizinsky
  - Mika Senghaas
format: event
tags:
  - welcome
  - aitu
  - first-meeting
banner:
  src: /assets/banner.jpg
  alt: The AITU Banner
ogImage:
  src: /assets/ogImage.jpg
  alt: The AITU Banner
published: 02/01/2023
---
```

_Note, that the `published` field required the date format MM/DD/YYYY and the
`image` and `layout` fields require either relative paths from the blog articles
directory (as can be seen in the `layout` field) or refer to public assets by
prefixing the path with `/` (as can be seen in the `image` field)._

At this point, you should be able to visit the new blog article at route
`http://localhost:3000/blog/<new-blogpost>` and see the meta information
rendering correctly.

### Write the Article

You can then go ahead and write regular Markdown - all default Markdown features
are available, like headers, dividers, bold and italic styles, links, images,
ordered/unordered lists, and block quotes. The below example shows how to write
a blog post using Markdown.

```md
# This is a header

This is a paragraph with some **bold** and _italic_ text. You can also add
[links](https://www.aitu.dk) and images:

![Aitu Logo](/assets/logo.png)

You can also add ordered lists:

1. First
2. Second

And unordered lists:

- First
- Second

## This is a subheader

---

> This is a block quote that is rendered after a divider

We support code blocks as well:
```

### Add a Title Image

All assets for a blog post should be stored in the directory
`public/posts/<blog-post>`. Your post should contain a minimum of two images,
which is the title image for your blog post in two different recommended sizes:

1. A wide **banner** image (`1455x398` px), called `banner.jpg`

2. A smaller **preview** image (`1200x630` px), called `ogImage.jpg`, which is
   used for previews on our own website and when we share links to the blog on
   common social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Choose an appropriate title image that is nice to look at and hints at the
post's contents. Make sure, it is a high-quality image, as the image will be
shown in large across the entire blog page. Assuming your title image is called
`titleImage.png`, run the following two commands:

```bash
magick titleImage.png -resize "1455x265^" -background black -gravity center -extent "1455x398" banner.jpg
magick titleImage.png -resize "1200x630^" -background black -gravity center -extent "1200x630" ogImage.jpg
```

This will create two images `banner.jpg` and `ogImage.jpg` with the correct
dimensions. Open both images to confirm that the processing was performed
correctly and that the image is not distorted. If you are not happy with the
result, you can always try again with a different image (some image dimensions
may not work well e.g. as the banner image). Also, note that the image size
should not exceed 150kB.

When you are happy with the result, move the images into the `public/posts`
directory and add the following metadata to your blog post:

```md
banner:
src: /public/posts/<blog-post>/banner.jpg
alt: A description of the image
ogImage:
src: /public/posts/<blog-post>/ogImage.jpg
alt: A description of the image
```

### Add Images

You can also add more images to your blog post. These images can be used to
illustrate the content of the post. To add an image place it in the
`public/posts/<blog-post>` directory and then add the following syntax to your
blog post:

```md
![alt text](/public/posts/<blog-post>/image.jpg)
```

Again, make sure that the image size does not exceed 150kB (`.jpg` is the
preferred image format as it uses compression). It the image significantly
exceeds the maximum file size, use online or CLI tools to compress the image.
Also, remember to add alt text for increased visibility (SEO).

### Adding Author Profile Image

If you have never authored a blog post before, just writing your name in the
`author` metadata field will not magically make an image of you appear. For this
to work, you will need to add your own avatar to the `public/authors` directory.
Note, that the naming of the file is critically important since Astro is
internally traversing the author meta tag (lowercasing and making spaces to
dashes) and searches for a match in the `public/authors` directory. This means
the following for adding an author image.

> `author: Mika Senghaas` -> `/public/authors/mika-senghaas.jpg`

‚úÖ Done. Thanks for making this project better!
